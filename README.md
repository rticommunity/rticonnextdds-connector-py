RTI Connector for Python
========================

**Note**: With the introduction of the RTI Connext Python API, 
*Connector for Python* is deprecated and has been removed in 7.3. You are 
encouraged to migrate to the [Connext Python API](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/api/connext_dds/api_python/index.html).  

**Note**: *Connector for Python* development is no longer active, so most files
have been removed. You are encouraged to look at the [`support/connector/1.2.0` maintenance branch](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector-py/tree/support/connector/1.2.0)
instead.
