Connext DDS Features
====================

.. py:currentmodule:: rticonnextdds_connector

*RTI Connector*, as a simplified API, provides access to a subset of the
features that *RTI Connext DDS* provides.

In addition to the functionality described in the rest of this documentation, this
section summarizes the support that *RTI Connector* provides for some notable
*RTI Connext DDS* features.

General features

   * - Feature
     - Level of support
     - Notes
   * - `Quality of Service (QoS) <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_QoS_Reference_Guide.pdf>`__
     - Partial
     - Most QoS policies are supported because they can be configured in XML, but those that are
       designed to be mutable can't be changed in Connector. QoS policies that require
       a supporting API may have limited or no support.

       A few examples of QoS policies that are fully supported in Connector:

        * Reliability
        * Durability
        * Ownership
        * Time-Based Filter

       A few examples of QoS policies that are supported but can't be changed in
       Connector even though they are mutable by design and changeable in other APIs:

        * Partition
        * Lifespan
        * Ownership Strength
        * Property and User Data

       A few examples of QoS policies that have limited support because they require
       a supporting API that is not available in Connector:

        * Batch - fully supported except that manual flushing is not available
        * Entity Factory - *autoenable_created_entities* can be set to *false* only for a *subscriber*, in
          order to enable an `Input` only when :meth:`Connector.get_input` is called.
        * Property - Properties can be set in XML, but they can't be looked up in Connector
   * - `Entity Statuses <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual/index.htm#UsersManual/Statuses.htm>`__
     - Partial
     - Only :meth:`Input.wait` (data available), :meth:`Input.wait_for_publications`, :meth:`Output.wait_for_subscriptions` are supported
   * - `Managing Data Instances <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual/index.htm#UsersManual/Managing_Data_Instances__Working_with_Ke.htm>`__
     - Partial
     - It is possible to dispose or unregister an instance (see :meth:`Output.write`), and instances are automatically registered when first written, but on the ``Input`` side, the instance status is not currently exposed. Instance handles are not exposed.
   * - `Application Acknowledgment <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual/index.htm#UsersManual/Application_Acknowledgment.htm>`__
     - Partial
     - *DDS_APPLICATION_AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGMENT_MODE* is supported. If enabled, when a call to :meth:`Input.take` or :meth:`Input.read` is followed by another call, the second one automatically acknowledges the samples read in the first one.

       *DDS_APPLICATION_EXPLICIT_ACKNOWLEDGMENT_MODE* is not supported.
   * - `Request-Reply <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual/index.htm#UsersManual/PartRequestReplyPattern.htm>`__
     - Partial
     - The correlation between two samples can be established at the application level:

            * The *Requester* application writes by calling :meth:`Output.write` with the parameter ``identity=A`` (the *request* sample)
            * The *Replier* application receives the *request* sample, obtains the ``identity`` (A),  from ":attr:`SampleIterator.info` and writes a new sample with ``related_sample_identity=A`` (the *reply* sample)
            * The *Requester* application receives the *reply* sample, and correlates the ``related_sample_identity`` from :attr:`SampleIterator.info` with the ``identity`` it used in the first step.

   * - `Topic Queries <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual/index.htm#UsersManual/TopicQueries.htm#23._Topic_Queries>`__
     - Partial
     - ``Input`` doesn't have the API to create a *TopicQuery*, but in the configuration file a *data_writer* can enable support for *TopicQuery* so other *RTI Connext DDS* subscribers can query the Connector publisher.
   * - `Zero Copy Transfer Over Shared Memory <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual/index.htm#UsersManual/SendingLDZeroCopy.htm>`__
     - Not supported
     - Only available in C and C++.
   * - `Built-in Topics <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual/index.htm#UsersManual/builtintopics.htm#builtintopics_3745276171_40053%3FTocPath%3DPart%25203%253A%2520Advanced%2520Concepts%7C17.%2520Built-In%2520Topics%7C_____0>`__

     - Partial
     - The built-in transports can be configured in XML, but add-ons cannot be loaded (see next)
   * - Add-on Libraries (`Monitoring <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual/index.htm#UsersManual/PartMonitoringLib.htm>`__, `Security Plugins <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/connext_dds/dds_security/html_files/RTI_SecurityPlugins_GettingStarted/index.htm>`__ ...)
     - Not supported
     - Connector can't currently load dynamically-linked add-on libraries.

Features related to the type system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table:: Features related to the type system
   :widths: 7 5 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Level of support
     - Notes
   * - `DDS type system <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual/index.htm#UsersManual/Introduction_to_the_Type_System.htm>`__
     - Supported
     - Connector can use any DDS type. Types are defined in XML.
   * - `Type extensibility <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds/getting_started_extras/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_GettingStarted_ExtensibleAddendum/index.htm#ExtensibleTypesAddendum/Type_Safety_and_System_Evolution.htm>`__
     - Supported
     - Connector supports type extensibility, including mutable types in the XML definition of types. It also supports type-consistency enforcement, sample-assignability enforcement; these checks are performed by the *RTI Connext DDS* Core.
   * - `Optional members <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds/getting_started_extras/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_GettingStarted_ExtensibleAddendum/index.htm#ExtensibleTypesAddendum/Optional_Members.htm>`__
     - Supported
     - See :ref:`Accessing optional members`
   * - `Default values <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds/getting_started_extras/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_GettingStarted_ExtensibleAddendum/index.htm#ExtensibleTypesAddendum/DefaultValue.htm>`__
     - Supported
     -  For example, to declare a default value for a member::

            <struct name= "MyType" extensibility="mutable">
                <!-- ... -->
                <member name="my_int" type="int32" default="20" />
            </struct>

        Now the value for *my_int* when you call :meth:`Output.write` without
        setting it explicitly is 20. And when you receive a data sample in an
        ``Input`` from a publisher whose type is compatible but doesn't have the
        field *my_int*, the value you receive is 20.

   * - `Unbounded data <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual/index.htm#UsersManual/Sequences.htm>`__
     - Supported
     -  To declare an unbounded sequence or string, set its max lenght to *-1*::

            <struct name= "MyType">
             <member name="my_unbounded_int_sequence" sequenceMaxLength="-1" type="int32"/>
             <member name="my_bounded_int_sequence" sequenceMaxLength="10" type="int32"/>
            </struct>

        For any ``Output`` using a topic for a type with unbounded members, set the
        following *property* QoS policy::

            <datawriter_qos>
             <!-- ... -->
             <property>
              <value>
               <element>
                <name>
                 dds.data_writer.history.memory_manager.fast_pool.pool_buffer_max_size
                </name>
                <value>4096</value>
               </element>
              </value>
             </property>
            </datawriter_qos>

        The value *4096* is a threshold that indicates *RTI Connext DDS* to allocate
        memory dynamically for data samples that exceed that size. For samples below
        that threshold, memory comes from pre-allocated buffers.

        If the unbounded member is a *key*, then in any ``Input`` that uses the type,
        set the following::

            <datareader_qos>
             <!-- ... -->
             <property>
              <value>
               <element>
                <name>
                 dds.data_reader.history.memory_manager.fast_pool.pool_buffer_max_size
                </name>
                <value>4096</value>
               </element>
              </value>
             </property>
            <datareader_qos>

   * - `FlatData Language Binding <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/connext_dds/html_files/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_UsersManual/index.htm#UsersManual/SendingLDFlatData.htm%3FTocPath%3DPart%25203%253A%2520Advanced%2520Concepts%7C22.%2520Sending%2520Large%2520Data%7C22.4%2520FlatData%2520Language%2520Binding%7C_____0>`__
     - Not supported
     - However, an ``Input`` can receive data published by other *RTI Connext DDS* applications that use FlatData
