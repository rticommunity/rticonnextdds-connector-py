Release Notes
=============

Supported Platforms
-------------------

*RTI Connector* works with Python® 2.x and 3.x. It uses a native C library that
runs on most Windows®, Linux® and macOS® platforms.

*Connector* has been tested with Python 2.6+ and 3.6.8+, and on the following systems:

**Linux**
  * CentOS™ 7.0 (x64)
  * Red Hat® Enterprise Linux 7, 7.3, 7.5, 7.6, 8 (x64)
  * SUSE® Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2 (x64)
  * Ubuntu® 18.04 (x64, Arm v7, Arm v8)
  * Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04 LTS (x64)

**macOS**
  * macOS 10.13-10.15, 12 (x64)
  * macOS 11 (x64 and Arm v8 tested via x64 libraries)

**Windows**
  * Windows 10, 11 (x64)
  * Windows Server 2016 (x64)

*Connector* is supported in other languages in addition to Python, see the 
`main Connector
repository <https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector>`__.


Native Windows libraries updated to Visual Studio 2015
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. CON-276

Previously, the native libraries shipped with Connector were built using Visual
Studio 2013 (and accompanied by Microsoft's mscvr120 redistributable). These
libraries are now built using Visual Studio 2015. The redistributable that is
shipped has been updated accordingly.


What's New in 1.2.0
-------------------

*Connector* 1.2.0 is built on `RTI Connext DDS 6.1.1 <https://community.rti.com/documentation/rti-connext-dds-611>`__.

New Platforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Connector* has been validated on macOS 11 (Big Sur) systems on x64 and Arm v8 
CPUs (via x64 libraries).


New API makes it easier to query what version of Connector is being used
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. CON-92 

A new API, :meth:`rticonnextdds_connector.Connector.get_version`, has been added that provides the caller
with the version of *Connector* and the version of the native libraries being used.


What's Fixed in 1.2.0
---------------------

Error logged when accessing string longer than 128 bytes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Previously, on an input, when accessing a string longer than 128 bytes, the
following error was printed:

.. code-block::

    Output buffer too small for member (name = "frame", id = 1). Provided size (128), requires size (x).

This error message was innocuous; there was actually no issue with retrieving
the string. The message is no longer printed.

[RTI Issue ID CON-157]


Deleting same Connector object twice may have resulted in segmentation fault
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A segmentation fault may have occurred when the same *Connector* object was
deleted twice. This issue has been resolved.

[RTI Issue ID CON-200]


Support added for handling large 64-bit integers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Support has been improved for both getting and setting large (greater than 2^53)
64-bit values. See :ref:`section-access-64-bit-integers` for more information.

Note that on Windows systems, the string representations of Not a Number and infinity
(e.g., ``'NaN'``, ``'Infinity'``) are not valid values for a Number. They are valid
inputs on other systems.

[RTI Issue ID CON-190]


Vulnerability Assessments
-------------------------
Internally, *Connector* relies on Lua. RTI has assessed the current version of 
Lua used by *Connector*, version 5.2, and found that *Connector* is not currently 
affected by any of the publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Lua 5.2.


Previous Releases
-----------------

Version 1.1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Connector* 1.1.1 is built on *RTI Connext DDS* 6.1.0.3, which fixes several
bugs in the Core Libraries. If you want more details on the bugs fixed in 6.1.0.3,
contact support@rti.com. These bugs are also fixed in
`RTI Connext DDS 6.1.1 <https://community.rti.com/documentation/rti-connext-dds-611>`__,
upon which *RTI Connector* 1.2.0 is built.

Version 1.1.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What's New in 1.1.0
"""""""""""""""""""

*Connector* 1.1.0 is built on `RTI Connext DDS 6.1.0 <https://community.rti.com/documentation/rti-connext-dds-610>`__.

Support added for ARMv8 architectures
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. CON-174 

Connector for Python now runs on ARMv8 architectures. Native libraries
built for ARMv8 Ubuntu 16.04 are now shipped alongside Connector. These libraries
have been tested on ARMv8 Ubuntu 16.04 and ARMv8 Ubuntu 18.04.

Sample state, instance state, and view state can now be obtained in Connector
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. CON-177

The SampleInfo class in *Connector* has been extended to provide access to the
sample state, view state, and instance state fields. These new fields work the
same as the existing fields in the structure (in *Connector* for Python they are
the keys to the dictionary, in *Connector* for JavaScript they are the keys to the
JSON Object).

Support for accessing the key values of disposed instances
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. CON-188

Support for disposing instances was added in *Connector* 1.0.0.
However, it was not possible to access the key values of the disposed instance.
This functionality is now available in the Python and JavaScript bindings.
When a disposed sample is received, the key values can be accessed.
The syntax for accessing these key values is the same as when the sample
contains valid data (i.e., using type-specific getters, or obtaining the entire
sample as an object). When the instance state is NOT_ALIVE_DISPOSED, only the
key values in the sample should be accessed.

Support for Security, Monitoring and other Connext DDS add-on libraries
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. CON-221

It is now possible to load additional Connext DDS libraries at runtime. This means
that Connext DDS features such as Monitoring and Security Plugins are now supported.
Refer to :ref:`Loading Connext DDS Add-On Libraries` for more information.

What's Fixed in 1.1.0
""""""""""""""""""""""

Support for loading multiple configuration files
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A *Connector* object now supports loading multiple files. This allows separating
the definition of types, QoS profiles, and *DomainParticipants* into different
files:

.. testcode::

  c = rti.Connector("my_profiles.xml;my_types.xml;my_participants.xml", configName)

[RTI Issue ID CON-209]

Some larger integer values may have been corrupted by Connector's internal JSON parser
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The internal JSON parser used in *Connector* failed to identify integer numbers
from double-precision floating-point numbers for certain values.
For example, if a number could not be represented as a 64-bit integer, the
parser may have incorrectly identified it as an integer, causing the value to
become corrupted. This problem has been resolved.

[RTI Issue ID CON-170]

Creating two instances of Connector resulted in a license error
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Under some circumstances, it was not possible to create two *Connector* objects.
The creation of the second *Connector* object failed due to a license error.
This issue affected all of the *Connector* APIs (Python, JavaScript).
This issue has been fixed.

[RTI Issue ID CON-163]

Creating a Connector instance with a participant_qos tag in the XML may have resulted in a license error
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In some cases, if the XML configuration file of *Connector* contained a
`<participant_qos>` tag within the definition of the *DomainParticipant*,
the creation of the *Connector* would fail with a "license not found" error.
This problem has been resolved.

[RTI Issue ID CON-214]

Version 1.0.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.0.0 is the first official release of *RTI Connector for Python* as well as
`RTI Connector for JavaScript <https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connector/1.0.0/api/javascript/index.html>`__.

If you had access to previous experimental releases, this release makes the product
more robust, modifies most of APIs and adds new functionality. However the old 
APIs have been preserved for backward compatibility as much as possible.

*RTI Connector* 1.0.0 is built on `RTI Connext DDS 6.0.1 <https://community.rti.com/documentation/rti-connext-dds-601>`__.
